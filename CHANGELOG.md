# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CLI: a `config` command (redacted effective configuration + credential source)
  and a `doctor --login` flag that verifies authentication. `doctor` now prints
  actionable guidance (pointing to `init`) when credentials are missing.
- API-surface snapshot test (`tests/test_api_surface_snapshot.py`) and a
  published stability contract (`docs/api-stability.md`) freezing the 42 tools,
  4 resources, and 7 prompts. The surface is now enforced in CI.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Non-blocking `pip-audit` dependency-audit workflow (weekly + on push) that
  surfaces known advisories in the resolved dependency tree without gating
  releases.
- Weekly scheduled CI run that re-resolves and retests against the latest
  in-range `capitalcom-cli` SDK, catching upstream regressions between commits.

### Changed
- Documented a **Tool Stability Policy** in `SECURITY.md` (tool names/semantics
  are stable within a major version; behaviour-changing edits ship as a new tool
  name or documented deprecation — anti "rug-pull").
- README now recommends **pinning the exact version** (`capitalcom-mcp==…`) for
  production / real-money use. No code or tool behaviour changes.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- The server now **starts without credentials**: the app is built lazily on the
  first broker call instead of eagerly in the lifespan. This lets MCP
  directories (e.g. Glama) introspect the tool list, and is friendlier for MCP
  clients (a missing-credential error now surfaces on first use, not at launch).

### Added
- `Dockerfile` (+ `.dockerignore`) that runs the stdio server and starts
  credential-free; a foundation for Glama checks and container/VPS hosting.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- Clarified the **unofficial** status on disclaimer-less surfaces: the PyPI
  summary and MCP Registry description now lead with "Unofficial", and the
  FastMCP server display name is "Capital.com MCP (unofficial)". No code or
  tool behavior changes. (This project is not affiliated with Capital.com.)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- MCP Registry server name now uses the correct GitHub namespace casing
  (`io.github.SimonTarara62/...`) so OIDC-authenticated registry publishing
  succeeds. The README ownership marker and registry badge were aligned to match.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Official MCP Registry manifest (`server.json`) and automated registry publishing.
- Full README reference for all 42 tools, 4 resources, and 7 prompts.
- Community-health files: CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, issue/PR
  templates, Dependabot config.
- PyPI version/Python/downloads and MCP Registry badges.

### Changed
- Built-in prompts now carry a consistent footer and explicit two-phase safety
  reminders.
- Enriched PyPI metadata (classifiers, keywords, project URLs).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Re-platformed onto the published `capitalcom-cli` SDK; removed the vendored
  broker engine.
- Relicensed MIT → Apache-2.0.

### Added
- `capitalcom-mcp` CLI (`run` / `doctor` / `init`), streamable-HTTP transport,
  full end-to-end test suite driving every tool against the demo API, and PyPI
  Trusted Publishing.
