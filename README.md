# Capital.com MCP Server

Self-hosted **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server for the **Capital.com Open
API**, written in Python on [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp). It
exposes **42 safe, guarded trading and market-data tools** — two-phase
execution, allowlists, demo-first — to any MCP client, over stdio or HTTP. Built
on the tested [`capitalcom-cli`](https://github.com/SimonTarara62/capitalcom-cli)
broker engine (SDK).

**Works with** Claude Desktop · Claude Code · Cursor · VS Code (Copilot) ·
Windsurf · ChatGPT — any MCP client.

## Install

No clone required — `uvx` runs it in an isolated, throwaway environment and
always fetches the latest tested release:

```bash
uvx capitalcom-mcp --help        # smoke test
```

Or install a persistent command with pipx:

```bash
pipx install capitalcom-mcp
```

### Pinning for production / real-money use

`uvx capitalcom-mcp` always runs the **latest** published release. That is fine
for trying it out, but for production or real-money use, **pin the exact
version** so an unexpected update can't change tool behavior under you:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capitalcom": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["capitalcom-mcp==0.3.4"],
      "env": { "CAP_ENV_FILE": "/Users/you/.config/capital-mcp/.env" }
    }
  }
}
```

The CLI form is `uvx capitalcom-mcp==0.3.4 run …`. Pin to a version you have
reviewed, and bump deliberately after reading the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## 1. Add your credentials (once)

Get an API key in the Capital.com app: **Settings → API integrations** (make a
**demo** key first). Then run the wizard — it writes a `0600` file and prints
the exact client snippet:

```bash
uvx capitalcom-mcp init
```

This writes `~/.config/capital-mcp/.env`. Verify any time (no secrets printed):

```bash
uvx capitalcom-mcp doctor
```

Inspect the full effective configuration (redacted, offline) or confirm your
credentials actually authenticate:

```bash
uvx capitalcom-mcp config          # effective settings + credential source
uvx capitalcom-mcp doctor --login  # verify authentication against the API
```

Prefer a secret manager? Set `CAP_API_KEY_CMD` / `CAP_IDENTIFIER_CMD` /
`CAP_API_PASSWORD_CMD` to a command that prints the secret (e.g.
`op read op://vault/...`, `pass ...`). The secret is fetched at launch and never
written to disk or to your client config.

## 2. Add the server to your client

Every client uses the same `command`/`args`/`env` shape. Pasting
`"CAP_ENV_FILE": "<path from init>"` keeps secrets out of the client file; or
put `CAP_API_KEY`/`CAP_IDENTIFIER`/`CAP_API_PASSWORD` directly in `env`.

### Claude Desktop
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) /
`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capitalcom": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["capitalcom-mcp"],
      "env": { "CAP_ENV_FILE": "/Users/you/.config/capital-mcp/.env" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio \
  --env CAP_ENV_FILE=/Users/you/.config/capital-mcp/.env \
  capitalcom -- uvx capitalcom-mcp
```

### Cursor
`~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capitalcom": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["capitalcom-mcp"],
      "env": { "CAP_ENV_FILE": "/Users/you/.config/capital-mcp/.env" }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code (Copilot)
`.vscode/mcp.json` — note the root key is `servers` and `type: "stdio"`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "capitalcom": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["capitalcom-mcp"],
      "env": { "CAP_ENV_FILE": "/Users/you/.config/capital-mcp/.env" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf
`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capitalcom": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["capitalcom-mcp"],
      "env": { "CAP_ENV_FILE": "/Users/you/.config/capital-mcp/.env" }
    }
  }
}
```

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT requires a **remote** server (stdio is not supported) — see
[Remote / VPS hosting](#remote--vps-hosting). Once your server is reachable over
HTTPS, enable **Developer Mode** (Settings → Connectors → Advanced) and add the
server URL ending in `/mcp`. ChatGPT **Deep Research** connectors call two
read-only tools, `search` and `fetch`, which this server implements; full custom
tools require Developer Mode.

## Remote / VPS hosting

Run with streamable-HTTP instead of stdio:

```bash
CAP_ENV_FILE=/home/you/.config/capital-mcp/.env \
  capitalcom-mcp run --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# endpoint: http://<host>:8000/mcp
```

Or via env (handy in systemd): `CAP_MCP_TRANSPORT=http`, `CAP_MCP_HOST`,
`CAP_MCP_PORT`. Put it behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy for any public use.

## What's inside — tools, resources & prompts

This server exposes **42 tools**, **4 resources**, and **7 guided prompts**. All
tool names are prefixed `cap_` except the two ChatGPT Deep Research adapters
(`search`, `fetch`). Mutating tools require `confirm=true`; trades are two-phase.
The full surface is a stable contract — see [API stability](docs/api-stability.md).

| `cap://market-cache/{epic}` | Cached market snapshot for an EPIC. |

### Guided prompts

Prompts are reusable workflows your client can launch by name. They emit
step-by-step guidance that orchestrates the tools above — they never trade on
their own.

| Prompt | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `market_scan` | Scan a watchlist for opportunities (prices + sentiment). |
| `trade_proposal` | Design a risk-sized trade and validate it via preview. |
| `execute_trade` | Safely execute a previously previewed trade. |
| `position_review` | Review open positions and working orders. |
| `live_price_monitor` | Stream prices and flag threshold moves. |
| `real_time_alerts` | Configure and watch live price alerts. |
| `live_portfolio_monitor` | Stream live portfolio P&L with a threshold. |

## Safety model
- Trading off unless `CAP_ALLOW_TRADING=true` **and** the EPIC is in
  `CAP_ALLOWED_EPICS` (or `ALL`).
- Two-phase execution; `confirm=true` required for mutations.
- Size, open-position, and daily-order caps; `CAP_DRY_RUN=true` blocks all
  executions. A `TIMEOUT` confirmation is ambiguous — reconcile, don't blindly retry.

## Development
```bash
make install   # editable MCP + capitalcom-cli SDK from PyPI
make check     # ruff + mypy + pytest (offline; no network/credentials)
```

End-to-end tests drive **every** tool through the MCP against the **demo** API
(read, watchlists, account switch, preview/execute/amend/close/cancel, streaming).
They place real demo orders and clean up after themselves, so use a demo `.env`
with trading + streaming enabled:

```bash
# demo .env: CAP_ALLOW_TRADING=true, CAP_ALLOWED_EPICS=GOLD, CAP_WS_ENABLED=true
CAP_MCP_E2E=1 pytest -m e2e -v
```
